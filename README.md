# Facial-Replacement
Homography based facial replacement using segmentation. This library focuses on utilizing segmentation to create a more pose invariant facial replacement method when using homography.

The basis of this library is made off of reference [2] for dense facial landmark collection.

This is a project for CS 8650, and was turned into a small informal paper.
